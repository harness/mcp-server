# Harness MCP Server - Go to Rust Migration Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating the Harness MCP Server from Go to Rust while maintaining the same functionality and structure.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### 1. Codebase Analysis and Documentation
- **Analyzed existing Go codebase structure and dependencies**
  - Identified modular architecture with toolsets for different Harness services
  - Documented main components: CLI with Cobra, authentication layer, toolset system
  - Catalogued key dependencies: mark3labs/mcp-go, harness-go-sdk, cobra, viper

- **Documented Go project architecture and key components**
  - Created comprehensive `GO_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md`
  - Detailed directory structure, core components, and service integration points
  - Documented build system, error handling patterns, and concurrency model

### 2. Rust Project Foundation
- **Created Rust project structure with appropriate Cargo.toml files**
  - Implemented workspace architecture with 6 modular crates:
    - `harness-core`: Main server logic and MCP protocol handling
    - `harness-auth`: Authentication and authorization
    - `harness-tools`: Tool implementations for different services
    - `harness-client`: HTTP client for Harness APIs
    - `harness-config`: Configuration management
    - `harness-utils`: Utility functions
  - Created main binary with CLI using clap
  - Added Rust-specific Dockerfile and Makefile
  - Implemented proper error handling with thiserror and anyhow
  - Set up async runtime with tokio and structured logging with tracing

- **Mapped Go dependencies to equivalent Rust crates**
  - Created comprehensive `DEPENDENCY_MAPPING.md`
  - Identified direct replacements: Cobraâ†’Clap, encoding/jsonâ†’serde_json, etc.
  - Documented custom implementation needs: MCP protocol, Harness SDK
  - Outlined architecture adaptations: Go interfacesâ†’Rust traits, Goroutinesâ†’Tokio tasks
  - Provided detailed migration strategy with implementation notes

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Workspace Architecture
- Modular crate structure for better organization and compilation
- Clear separation of concerns between authentication, tools, client, and core logic
- Reusable components across different parts of the application

### 2. Error Handling Strategy
- `thiserror` for custom error types with proper error chains
- `anyhow` for error context and easy error propagation
- Rust's `Result<T, E>` type for explicit error handling

### 3. Async Runtime
- Tokio for async I/O operations and concurrency
- Async/await pattern for HTTP requests and MCP protocol handling
- Proper cancellation and timeout support

### 4. Configuration Management
- Environment variable support with `clap`
- Structured configuration with validation
- Support for both external (API key) and internal (bearer token) modes

### 5. Logging and Observability
- Structured logging with `tracing`
- Configurable log levels and output formats
- JSON logging support for production environments

## Remaining Work ðŸš§

### High Priority
1. **Migrate core data structures and types from Go to Rust**
   - Convert Go structs to Rust structs with proper serialization
   - Implement Rust traits equivalent to Go interfaces
   - Handle ownership and borrowing for complex data structures

2. **Migrate business logic and core functionality**
   - Port toolset management and registration logic
   - Implement license validation system
   - Convert service clients and API interactions

3. **Migrate API endpoints and HTTP handlers**
   - Implement MCP protocol message handling
   - Port tool execution logic
   - Add proper request/response validation

4. **Migrate database interactions and data access layer**
   - Port any database operations (if applicable)
   - Implement connection pooling and transaction handling
   - Add proper error handling for database operations

5. **Validate functionality parity between Go and Rust versions**
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Verify all tools work identically
   - Performance comparison and optimization

### Medium Priority
6. **Implement error handling using Rust Result types**
   - Enhance error types with more specific variants
   - Add error context and debugging information
   - Implement proper error recovery strategies

7. **Convert tests from Go to Rust testing framework**
   - Port unit tests to Rust's built-in test framework
   - Add integration tests with tokio-test
   - Implement HTTP mocking for API tests

8. **Update build scripts and CI/CD configurations for Rust**
   - Update CI pipelines for Rust compilation
   - Add cargo-based build and test automation
   - Update deployment scripts for Rust binary

9. **Performance testing and optimization**
   - Benchmark Rust vs Go performance
   - Optimize memory usage and allocation patterns
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

### Low Priority
10. **Migrate documentation and comments to Rust doc style**
    - Convert Go comments to Rust doc comments
    - Generate API documentation with `cargo doc`
    - Update README and usage examples

## Technical Challenges Identified

### 1. MCP Protocol Implementation
- No existing Rust crate for MCP protocol
- Need to implement JSON-RPC 2.0 message handling from scratch
- Ensure compatibility with existing MCP clients

### 2. Harness SDK Migration
- No Rust equivalent of harness-go-sdk
- Need to reimplement all Harness API interactions
- Maintain compatibility with existing API contracts

### 3. Configuration Management
- Viper (Go) has more features than config (Rust)
- May need custom configuration watching and validation
- Environment variable handling differences

### 4. Concurrency Model Changes
- Go goroutines â†’ Rust async/await with Tokio
- Channel-based communication patterns
- Proper cancellation and timeout handling

## Next Steps

1. **Start with core data structures migration** - This provides the foundation for all other components
2. **Implement basic MCP protocol handling** - Essential for server functionality
3. **Port authentication layer** - Required for API access
4. **Migrate tool implementations incrementally** - Start with simpler tools first
5. **Add comprehensive testing** - Ensure functionality parity throughout migration

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance equal to or better than Go version
- [ ] Memory usage optimized
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline working
- [ ] Documentation complete and accurate

## Resources Created

- `GO_ARCHITECTURE_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive Go codebase analysis
- `DEPENDENCY_MAPPING.md` - Complete dependency migration guide
- `Cargo.toml` - Workspace configuration with all dependencies
- `src/main.rs` - Main entry point with CLI implementation
- Modular crate structure with proper separation of concerns
- Rust-specific build and deployment configurations

The foundation for the Rust migration is now complete. The next phase involves the actual code migration, starting with core data structures and working up through the application layers.
