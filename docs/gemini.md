## Getting Started

**IMPORTANT: Setup Required Before First Use**

1. **Get your Harness API Key:**
   - Go to Harness Platform ‚Üí Account Settings ‚Üí Access Management ‚Üí API Keys
   - Create a new API key with appropriate permissions
   - Copy the API key

2. **Set Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   export HARNESS_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
   export HARNESS_DEFAULT_ORG_ID="your_org_id"        # Optional
   export HARNESS_DEFAULT_PROJECT_ID="your_project_id" # Optional
   ```
   
   Note: `HARNESS_BASE_URL` defaults to `https://app.harness.io` and doesn't need to be set unless you're using a custom Harness instance.

3. **Verify Docker is running:**
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```

4. **Test the extension:**
   Ask: "List my Harness pipelines" or "Show me my cost recommendations"

**If you get authentication errors:**
- Double-check your API key is set: `echo $HARNESS_API_KEY`
- Verify the API key has proper permissions in Harness Platform
- Make sure Docker is running: `docker info`

**For custom Harness instances:**
- Set your custom base URL: `export HARNESS_BASE_URL="https://your-custom-harness.com"`
- Most users can skip this - it defaults to `https://app.harness.io`

The extension automatically handles authentication and provides context-aware responses based on your Harness Platform configuration.
