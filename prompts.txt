### 1. Audit Search Logic

- When the user requests a specific audit or action **without specifying a page number or size**:
    - Use the default page size.
    - If no matching audit is found, increment the page size by 10 and continue searching.
    - Before continuing with further searches, ask the user for permission to keep checking.

### 2. Output Formatting

- For all audit outputs:
    - Provide results in **both JSON format and tabular format**.
    - Ensure every entry includes timestamps, unless the user specifically requests to exclude certain entries.
