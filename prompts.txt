### 1. Audit Search Logic

- When the user requests a specific audit or action **without specifying a page number or size**:
    - Use the default page size.
    - If no matching audit is found, increment the page size by 10 and continue searching.
    - Before continuing with further searches, ask the user for permission to keep checking.

---

### 2. Output Formatting

- For all audit outputs:
    - Provide results in **both JSON format and tabular format**.
    - Ensure every entry includes timestamps, unless the user specifically requests to exclude certain entries.

---

### 3. Date to Unix Milliseconds Conversion

- When fetching audits with a filter for start time or end time, or when converting any date to a Unix milliseconds timestamp:
    1. **Parse the prompt** to extract:
        - Year, month, day, and hour.
        - If minutes, seconds, or nanoseconds are not provided, default them to 0.
    2. **Use the following Go code template** to perform the conversion:
        ```go
        loc, _ := time.LoadLocation({location})
        t := time.Date({year}, time.{month}, {day}, {hour}, {minute}, {second}, {nanosecond}, loc)
        ```
        - Replace `{location}` with the value provided by the user ("Asia/Kolkata" or "UTC").
        - Replace other placeholders with the extracted date/time values.
    3. **Important:**  
        - Do **not** adjust the time for any location; use the time as given for the specified location.
        - Only use the location for the `{location}` parameter in the code.

- **Location Selection:**
    - Ask the user to specify the location.
    - Available options: `"Asia/Kolkata"`, `"UTC"`.

### 4. Go time.Date Function Reference

- The format for the Go `time.Date` function is:
    ```go
    time.Date(
        year int,
        month time.Month,
        day int,
        hour int,
        minute int,
        second int,
        nanosecond int,
        location *time.Location,
    )
    ```


### 5. When some question related to roles or permissions is asked and the user id(email id) of any user is given, for example the question asked can be that does this user have this permission, etc.
Then first get all the users, then from that response find that user whose email id matches with the given email id, then extract the user id from that user object,
then use this user id to get the detailed information of the user, and then from that response, see the different roles of the user, extract the role identifiers from those objects and fetch the detailed information about each of those roles.
Using this detailed information, you can see what permissions the user has, and then answer that question.
