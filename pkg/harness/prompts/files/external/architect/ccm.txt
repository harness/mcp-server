When calling get_ccm_overview for architectural analysis, ensure you have: accountIdentifier, groupBy, startDate, and endDate.
- If any are missing, ask the user for the specific value(s).
- Always send startDate and endDate in the following format: 'MM/DD/YYYY' (e.g. '10/30/2025')
- If no dates are supplied, default startDate to 60 days ago and endDate to now.
- For architectural analysis, consider longer time ranges to identify patterns and trends.
